        <h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>The favorite waste of time. How I curse this passion of mine.</p>
        <h3>My current top 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>League of Legend</li>
            <li>Starcraft</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>League of Legend</h3>
        <p>I started playing league in 2011, around the same time I started high school. A classmate of mine encouraged me to play it. Even though I became friends with him and liked the game a lot, we didn't actually play a whole lot together. I played mostly on my own and made many friends online and offline doing so. I don't have it as actively as I did back then, but this game probably waste a huge part of my life and I still love it. I have only hit platinum in ranked, so it isn't anything noteworth to show. Instead here is a clip of one of my favorite moments.</p>

        <h3>Starcraft</h3>
        <p>A game I started playing around 2012 because another friend coerced me into getting it. We played it together for a bit and then stopped. Seems to be a running trend. I play a bit more of it on my own, mostly on and off every now and then. I couldn't play a lot because of how intense get and carpal tunnel syndrome. But I been playing it more lately and working out my wrist. My best performance in rank is Diamond. The ranking goes Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master/Grandmaster.</p>

        <h2>Art and Anime</h2>
        <p>My love for art is pretty synonomous with my love with anime. Much of my favorite art is made in the style that anime and manga are pictured in. Here is a picture I really like from my favorite anime, Full Metal Alchemist.</p>

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>I like to write as well. Mostly story telling. Not much to say about this subject. Ironic.</p>
